Binding for Qualcomm Atheros AR7xxx/AR9XXX MISC interrupt controller

The MISC interrupt controller is a secondary controller for lower priority
interrupt.

Required Properties:
- compatible: has to be "qca,<soctype>-cpu-intc", "qca,ar7100-misc-intc"
  as fallback
- reg: Base address and size of the controllers memory area
- interrupt-parent: phandle of the parent interrupt controller.
- interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode interrupt
		     source, should be 1

Please refer to interrupts.txt in this directory for details of the common
Interrupt Controllers bindings used by client devices.

Example:

	interrupt-controller@18060010 {
		compatible = "qca,ar9132-misc-intc", qca,ar7100-misc-intc";
		reg = <0x18060010 0x4>;

		interrupt-parent = <&cpuintc>;
		interrupts = <6>;

		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
	};
